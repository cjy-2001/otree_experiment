# otree_experiment
Sticky prices experiment based on oTree.

Players will play as different firms and decide if they will change their prices given an upcoming cost shock; whoever gets the highest profit wins.

Served as a real-life experiment to test the Nominal Rigidity (or sticky prices) theory.
