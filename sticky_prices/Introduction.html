        <em>
          Welcome to our economics experiment!
        </em>
    </p>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> General Idea </b>
    <p>
        In this experiment you will act as a seller.
        Each period you will produce fictitious items, call them widgets, and you must decide what price to charge.
        The profits you earn for selling your widgets depend on the price you set, the price your competitors set,
        and the costs you incur for producing the widgets.
        There will be {{ other_members }} other sellers participating in the market with you.
        The demand for the widgets is automated (determined by the computer, not humans) and depends on the prices in the market.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will choose prices in a series of {{ C.NUM_PRACTICE_ROUNDS }} practice round and {{ C.NUM_REAL_ROUNDS }} real rounds.
        Each of these rounds are “one-shot” games, meaning that decisions you make in a previous round do no impact decisions or profits you can make in later rounds.
    </p>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Decisions </b>
    <p>
        In each round you will begin with an old price of {{ group.init_price }}.
        Call this yesterday’s price.
        Yesterday’s cost of producing a widget was {{ group.cost }}.
        In each round you will be notified of a change in your production cost.
        When your production cost falls it will be cheaper for you to produce the widgets,
        and, similarly, when your production cost rises it will be more expensive for you to produce the widgets.
        With these new production costs, you will decide what you would like your new price to be.
        You can leave your price at {{ group.init_price }} or change it to whatever level you like.
        Note that it’s possible that leaving your price at yesterday’s price of {{ group.init_price }} may be the best thing to do.
        <b>All the other sellers in the market will face the same production costs as you do.</b>
    </p>

    <div>
        <em>Quiz 1:</em>
        {{ formfield quiz1 }}
    </div>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Profits </b>

    <p>
        <em>Cost: the production cost you incur per widget</em><br>
        <em>Price: the amount of money buyers pay to you per widget</em><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The profits you earn in each round are determined by your price, your production cost, the average price set in the market,
        and if you incur a cost associated with changing your price from {{ group.init_price }}.
        The profits you earn in each round will be determined by:
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Profit = (Your price – new production cost)*Demand – (cost to change prices)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The Demand for your widgets will decrease as you raise your price and it will increase as the average price in the market increases.
        Specifically, the Demand for your widgets is given by:
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Demand = {{ group.alpha }} – {{ group.beta }}*(Your Price)+ {{ group.theta }}*(Average price in market)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        To help you make the best decisions, the experiment will include a profit calculator with these equations (more on this below).
    </p>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Prices of other sellers </b>
    <p>
        As highlighted above, your profits will, in part, be determined by the pricing decisions of the other sellers in the market.
        You will not know the others’ decisions until after you make your own price choice.
        Therefore, to guide your pricing decision, it’s important to think about how the other sellers in the market will behave.
        To aid you in this process, the experiment will include a table where you will enter how likely it is that the average price in the market will take some value.
        Below are two examples.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Belief Example 1.</em>
    </p>
    <table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Average Price</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th><th>11</th><th>12</th><th>13</th><th>Total Probability Percentage (must sum to 100)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Probability</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>100</td>
  </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        <em>Belief Example 2.</em>
    </p>
    <table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Average Price</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th><th>11</th><th>12</th><th>13</th><th>Total Probability Percentage (must sum to 100)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Probability</td><td>0</td><td>100</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>100</td>
  </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        In each round you will enter values in the “Probability” row.
        These will be your beliefs about the probability that the average price will take a value in the “Average Price” row.
        In Belief Example 1, this seller believes that in this period there is a 50% chance the average price in the market will be $10,
        and a 50% change the average price in the market will be $11 (thus they believe the mean price in the market will be $10.5) .
        Note that the sum of the probabilities you enter must sum to 1 (computed for you in the “Total Probability” column).
    </p>

    <p>
        In Belief Example 2, this seller believes that there is a 100% chance the average price in the market will be $8,
        i.e. that all sellers will choose a price of $8.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>You can change the probabilities you enter as many times as you like during a round.</em>
    </p>

    <div>
        <em>Quiz 4:</em>
        {{ formfield quiz4 }}
    </div>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Profit Calculator </b>
    <p>
        Using the beliefs you enter about the average price in the market, you will then be able to experiment with different values for your price.
        Moving the price slider will take these different hypothetical prices and compute your expected profit.
        As an example, if your price slider is currently at $11 the computer will calculate your profit associated with this price of $11.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Profit Example 1.</em>
    </p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th>If you:</th><th></th><th>Your expected profit</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Change price to:</td><td>$11</td><td>-$2.28</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Keep price at:</td><td>$10</td><td>$2.32</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        In Profit Example 1, the computer is showing you that if you change your price to $11 you should expect to lose $2.28 in this round.
        Alternatively, it also shows you that if you leave your price at $10, you should expect to earn $2.32 in this round.
        It is important to emphasize that these calculations are computed using your beliefs about what the average price in the market will be.
        Thus, conditional on your beliefs and costs of selling the widgets, you would be best to leave your price at $10 in this round.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Profit Example 2.</em>
    </p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th>If you:</th><th></th><th>Your expected profit</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Change price to:</td><td>$12.6</td><td>$0.44</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Keep price at:</td><td>$10</td><td>-$7.4</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        In Profit Example 2, the computer is showing you that if you change your price to $12.6 you should expect to earn $0.44 in this round.
        Alternatively, it also shows you that if you leave your price at $10, you should expect to lose $7.4 in this round.
        Thus, conditional on your beliefs and costs of selling the widgets, you would be best to change your price in this round.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that it’s possible that in a given round you may not be able to avoid losing money.
        In this case the best thing you can to is to choose the option where you lose the least money.
    </p>

    <div>
        <em>Quiz 5:</em>
        {{ formfield quiz5 }}
    </div>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Cost to Change Prices </b>
    <p>
        In each round, if you decide to change your price you will incur a price adjustment cost of {{ group.adjust_cost }}.
        The profit calculator detailed above will incorporate this price adjustment cost when it computes your expected profit associated with changing your price.
        These price adjustment costs are the reason that changing your price in a round may not always be the best thing to do.
    </p>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Other sellers in your market </b>
    <p>
        In each round, you will be randomly (and anonymously) matched with other sellers into groups of {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }}.
        This random matching will occur at the start of each Round.
        Therefore, the other sellers in the market with you may, or may not, be the same as those who were in your market in the previous Round.
    </p>

    <br>

    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Earnings </b>
    <p>
        In the experiment you will begin with {{ C.START_EARNINGS }}.
        For the {{ C.NUM_REAL_ROUNDS }} rounds in the experiment, we will tally your earnings (or loses) and add (subtract) these values from your initial {{ C.START_EARNINGS }}.
        You will be anonymously paid this value at the completion of the experiment.
